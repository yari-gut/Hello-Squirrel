# AND101 Project 1 - Hello, Squirrel!

Submitted by: Yareli Gutierrez

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

Hello-Squirrel is an android app that recreates the common "Hello, World!", to introduce ourselves to the neighborhood squirrel üêø. Through a list of hobbies and a bio description, we personalize our introduction.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ü§îüò≤üòÅ

## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!

From this unit, I learned more about how to operate Android studio and code with the language Kotlin. Moreover, I was able to experiment with the background colors and design through the activity_main.xml file. This unit was enjoyable, and it was a great way to begin my Android Development knowledge through this project.
